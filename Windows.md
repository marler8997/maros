Building maros on windows is not currently supported but I've worked on it a bit.

# Creating symbol links

If you want to link `mar` to a repo you can use the `mklink` command, but it requires running a console "As Administrator":
```batch
# NOTE: Must Run As Administrator
mklink mar ../mar
```
