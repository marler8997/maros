User-level do most of the mapping between kernel and user
capabilities based on the version tag given by the kernel. The
kernel might be somewhat backwards compatible, but don't bet on
it.

Note, cap_t, is defined by POSIX (draft) to be an "opaque" pointer to
a set of three capability sets.  The transposition of 3*the
following structure to such a composite is better handled in a user
